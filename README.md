##### Prerequisites

This course requires the use of some standard tools for programming. You should:

* install Github Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/);
* create a Github account;
* install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/);
* Set VSCode as editor for Github Desktop;
* bring your computer to the first session so that we can fix any issues you
    might have with these.
* disregard the above, if you already have a working setup (other than jupyter notebooks).

##### Reference Material 

Programming:

* Downey (2015). _Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_. Green
    Tea Press.
* Herman (2014). _A functional start to computing with Python_. Franklin, Beedle
    & Associates Inc.
* Beazley & Jones (2013). _Python Cookbook_. O'Reilly Media. (Let us know if you
    cannot find a copy)
* [SICP in Python](https://wizardforcel.gitbooks.io/sicp-in-python/content/index.html)
* Stavely (2014). _Programming and Mathematical Thinking: A Gentle Introduction
    to Discrete Math Featuring Python_. The New Mexico Tech Press.
* [Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

Discrete Mathematics:

* Levin (2019). _Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction_. University
    of Northern Colorado. [Link](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/dmoi.html)
* Rosen (2019). _Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications_. McGraw-Hill.
* Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis (2008). _Introduction to Probability_. Athena
    Scientific.

##### Conduct and Requirements 

* The course will be based on weekly assignments and quizzes.
* Assignments are not graded but are necessary for the quizzes.
* You CANNOT take the quiz without submitting the assignment of that week.
* The quizzes will be based on the assignments, discussions in the class, and
    the previous content.
* The weight of the quizzes will be decided on the basis of their difficulty.
* The quizzes will be pencil-and-paper, and any sort of material will be
    disallowed.
* The quizzes will start at 17:00, and you will have 30 minutes to complete
    them.
* Attendance is not required, you can come only to the quizzes, provided that
    you submit the assignment of that week on time.
* There will be an in-class final exam at the end of the term.

##### Make-ups

Only available by medical report or business trip document covering the session date, again provided that you submit the assignment.
